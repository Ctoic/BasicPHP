## Introduction to LAMP

LAMP is a popular stack of open-source software used for web development. It stands for:

- **Linux**: The operating system
- **Apache**: The web server
- **MySQL**: The database management system
- **PHP**: The server-side scripting language

This stack provides a powerful platform for developing dynamic web applications. In this repository, we focus on the PHP component, which is used to develop server-side logic, handle form data, interact with databases, and more.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you will need to have a LAMP stack installed on your local machine. Here are the steps to set up a LAMP stack:

1. **Install Linux**: If you are not already using a Linux-based operating system, you can install one. Popular distributions include Ubuntu, Debian, and CentOS.
2. **Install Apache**: You can install Apache using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use the command:
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install apache2
